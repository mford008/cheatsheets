* **How it's built**: These cheatsheets are written originally in Markdown,
  converted into LaTeX using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and a custom
  [pandoc LaTeX template](./templates/template.tex) (very messy), and then
  generates the PDF.  All this is tied together using the Bash script
  [build.sh](./build.sh).

* **Writing your own**: Want to write your own printable coding cheatsheets?
  It's easy, as long as you know Markdown! Look at the existing `.md` source
  files for ideas, then follow the [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for
  instructions on how to re-build the PDFs yourself.

* **License**: These cheatsheets and the scripts involved with their build
  process are (C) Kickstart Coding and released under the GPL 3.0
